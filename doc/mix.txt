INTRODUCTION                                    *mix*

This plugin is designed to use the commands to navigate in a Mix project. It
is heavily inspired by rake.vim.

Projects are detected by searching for a Mix file (mix.exs) up the directory
hierarchy. This handles umbrella applications by checking that the Mix file
isn't in and "apps" directory.
